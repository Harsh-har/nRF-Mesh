# Android-nRF-Mesh-Library
About (Updated)
This project is a customized and extended implementation of the Android-nRF-Mesh-Library, built on top of Nordic Semiconductor’s official Bluetooth Mesh stack.
In addition to standard provisioning and mesh control, this application introduces advanced usability, automation, and device-level visibility features tailored for real-world deployments and large mesh networks.
✨ Custom Enhancements Added
 
1. Short & Long Command Support
Implemented short commands for quick mesh operations (e.g. fast On/Off, Level changes).
Added long commands for advanced configuration, diagnostics, and detailed node control.
Improves response time and flexibility for different use cases.    

2. Search View for Nodes & Devices
Integrated SearchView to quickly find:
Devices by Node Name
MAC Address
UUID
Extremely useful for large mesh networks with many provisioned nodes.

3. MAC Address Visibility
Extended mesh database and UI layers to:
Display BLE MAC Address alongside Node Name and UUID
Persist MAC address mapping after provisioning
Helps in:
Device identification
Debugging
Field installation & maintenance

4. Auto Proxy Connect
Implemented automatic Proxy Node connection logic:
App automatically connects to the best available Proxy node
Reduces manual intervention
Improves reliability after app restart or disconnection
Handles reconnection seamlessly during network changes.

5. Improved Network & Node Handling
Enhanced handling of:
Proxy Filter updates
Node binding and re-binding
Network refresh scenarios
Better stability during large network operations.

6. UI & UX Improvements
Cleaner node listing with:
Device Name
MAC Address
UUID
Faster navigation and improved control screens.
Optimized workflows for provisioning and configuration.

🔗 Base Compatibility (Unchanged Core)
Bluetooth Mesh Profile 1.0.1
Mesh Model Specification 1.0.1
Mesh Configuration Database 1.0
Fully compatible with Nordic’s Android BLE Library
